<!-- npm install bcryptjs jsonwebtoken
 -->

 <!-- npm install sqlite3 sqlite -->

JWT = login identity token

Middleware = gatekeeper that validates token

JWT is created on login

Stored in frontend

Sent with every request

Middleware verifies it

Backend gets req.user.id

Data becomes user-specific-->
